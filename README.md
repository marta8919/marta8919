 <h3>I am a creative problem-solver passionate about designing innovative solutions that put the user experience at the forefront.</h3>
</div>

<div>
  <p>My experience primarily revolves around working with TypeScript and frameworks like React and Next.js to develop seamless, user-friendly interfaces. User experience is at the heart of my work, guiding both the creation of new solutions and the implementation of existing ones.</p>
  <p>Collaboration is at the core of my work style; I thrive in team environments, enjoy solving technical and business challenges together, and celebrate shared and individual successes.</p>
  <p>In addition to being a frontend developer, I am an avid reader, a knitter and a crocheter. I am also a certified yoga teacher and, more recently, a passionate bread baker 👩‍🍳.</p>
  <p>Currently learning Swedish 🇸🇪 and Angular 👩‍💻.</p>
