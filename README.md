<div>
  <p>My experience primarily revolves around working with TypeScript and frameworks like React and Next.js to develop seamless, user-friendly interfaces. User experience is at the heart of my work, guiding both the creation of new solutions and the implementation of existing ones.</p>
  <p>Collaboration is at the core of my work style; I thrive in team environments, enjoy solving technical and business challenges together, and celebrate shared and individual successes.</p>
  <p>In addition to being a frontend developer, I am an avid reader, a knitter and a crocheter. I am also a certified yoga teacher and, more recently, a passionate bread baker 👩‍🍳.</p>
  <p>I am fluent in English, Catalan and Spanish, and currently learning Swedish 🇸🇪.</p>
